== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I test the plugin compression before I purchase credit from way2enjoy? =
    Yes, you can. We gives free testing quota of 1000/month with that you can compress image, mp3, pdf, svg.

= Will the optimized images remain on my blog if I uninstall the plugin? =
    Yes, of-course they will. We simply replaces with optimized image

= Where can I find the option to optimize my Media Libary images? =
    Unoptimized images will appear in Way2enjoy dashboard. You can compress image with one click.just click on compress all button and all images will be optimized. 

= What is the difference between Way2enjoy image optimizer and other image compression plugins such as Optimus, shortpixel, ewww, wp smush, imagify, kraken, resmush and tinypng Compress jpeg & png images/ tinyjpg? =
    Way2enjoy finds the precise balance between image quality and file size reduction. Plugin api utilizes various mechanisms to optimize pictures for ensuring that the result cannot be distinguished by the human eye, so plugin will outperform other plugins

= Which formats can be optimized? =
    It can compress jpg, png, gif images. It can compress pdf and MP3 files also. upload svg support is added so your svg can be uploaded and compressed

= Should I continue optimizing and resizing with Photoshop? =
    Dont waste resizing and optimizing images in Photoshop. Plugin will reduce image size automatically!

= Why way2enjoy image optimizer credit is number instead of size ? =
It depends on algorithm. for example Optimus, shortpixel, ewww, tinypng counts each image as 1 credit however imagify, kraken etc credit varies with size. wp smush, resmush does not do either.

= Google Pagespeed Insights still says my images need compressing and resizing? =
    Try lossy as it will save more. Scale down images. Scaling images just by setting width and height **under resize image setting** can save space and reduce image loading time. Decide right size and scale images down. Image optimization is complex task and required lot of resources. Google pagespeed Insights decide based on quality (probably 70) and we tries to reduce image size ensuring best possible quality so you can ignore google pagespeed warning else you can manually change the default quality setting.

= How does the plugin work? =
    Way2enjoy image optimizer sends the original images to our Cloud for compression then downloads the optimized images and the unoptimized originals are replaced with the compressed images. 

= Do you optimize images in cloud? =
    Images processsed by plugin are optimized in Cloud. 

= What is image compression? =
    Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission. Algorithms may take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic compression methods

= What payment methods are accepted? =
    PayPal, Bitcoin.

= What is diff between baseline image and progressive JPEG and which one i should use? =
    Baseline image starts loading from top to bottom and progressive JPEG loads from low quality to high quality so without loading of full image, preview can be seen almost instantly. For websites, where loading time is most important factor, progressive images are preferred. Our image compression algorithm generates progressive jpeg. 

= How much is a credit? =
    Each time way2enjoy optimizes an image or thumbnail credit is used. If we are unable to optimize image or thumbnail then no credit will be used

= Which conversion mode I should select? =
    Lossy conversion is best as it will shrink image more at minimal loss.
    Lossless conversion will result in minor saving.With lossless google pagespeed will give warning so prefer lossy but every website is unique so decide between    lossy and lossless. 
    Lossless will give 2-7% saving compared to lossy huge saving(upto 90%).

= Does optimizing images affect my ALT tags? =
    No, We only optimize images.If you have set the width and height for resizing image, then it will resize image in addition to compressing images. 

= Does sites like facebook, twitter, reddit, pinterest, youtube and amazon uses image optimisation ? =
    Almost all sites uses image optimisation to speedup site loading time and performance.

= How can one enable svg support ? =
    SVG files are vector images which scales well. In setting page you have option to enable svg support which will allow you to upload svg files. You can disable anytime and svg support will be blocked. Tick it again to add svg files.

= How to include webp images ? =
    You can replace img tags with picture tags to include webp images.

= What is difference between JPEG, PNG and GIF images and how they are compressed ?=
    PNG can hold transparency of images,so it can be put on any frame and it will adjust in that image or block. We compress png with utmost care and maintains transparency even with lossy. GIF images can hold animation so when you need animation, choose gif format. We use best algorithm to compress gif and ensures that animation works. JPG or JPEG images are most widely used image format. Plugin decides optimum balance automatically to compress jpg so that you get best quality and best compression together. 

= Is it free ? =
    We give unrestricted (upload 50MB file,no issue) access and limit of 1000 images/month. Every month you get 1000 images to compress and all unused credit will be carried forward.Refer and earn 2500 free credit instantly free of cost to both sites.

= optimize or optimise? =
    It depends. But whether you pronounce optimize, optimise, optimizer, crunch, minify, reducer or reduce size for better speed,seo and performance all are synonyms.

= How does video optimizer works ? =
    It optimizes all video format. credit for video optimization and mp3 optimization are dynamic and not like image optimization where 1 credit is used for each image

= It will work in localhost? =
    No
